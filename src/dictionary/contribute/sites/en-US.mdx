# Improve SudoTV The Main

## Using the web editor

The content and source code of the SudoTV The Main website is located in the SudoTV The Main repository:

- [The-Main](https://github.com/SudoTV/TheMain)

You can edit the content and metadata directly in the web editor.

For pages that are rendered using static documentation, you may see this information at the bottom of the page:

<ContributeAnnotation
    config={{
        repository: {
            platform: "GITHUB",
            owner: "SudoTV",
            repository: "The-Main",
        },
        branch: "main",
        
        paths: [
            "src",
            "dictionary",
            "contribute",
            "series",
            "en-US.mdx",
        ],
    }}
    locale="en-US"
/>

Click the link to go to the edit page. You will be redirected to the repository's web editor. You may need an account to edit the content. If you don't have one, you can create one for free.

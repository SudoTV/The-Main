## Fork Repository

If you have already forked the {props.parameters.repositoryName} repository, you can skip this part. However, if your fork is created a while before, you might need to sync the upstream to get your fork updated first.

To create a new fork, visit the <MDX_A href={props.parameters.repositoryUrl}>{props.parameters.repositoryName} Repository</MDX_A>. Click `Fork` button on the top right corner. You may need to sign-in or create a account if you don't have one already. A new fork is already updated, you don't to need to sync a fork that just created.
